David : Each year men from all around the country in each village and town would come together to have matches. The strongest and wisest would gain permission to be visited by the queen, and receive the honor of attending the Royal School off Ghana. 
In the little town of Giraffes, two men were able to stand against all odds Daniel from the clan off panda assassins, and Bogdan from the Mages of the Holy Cross. And now today was the coronation of these two men. As they stood at the entrance of the gates, awaiting the arrival of the Queen. They saw her in the distance moving in with a group of 80 armed soldiers and the Queen of worshitania who went by the name of Veronika the Swift was riding her Great Elephant from the Blue warrior clan, while right beside her was her great advisor following, Emma the Czar Fince Wise Woman. 


Bogdan: (The Queen finally approached the two men with a disgusted look. “These? This tall stick and pale rock are the supposed victors?” Bogdan and Daniel immediately bowed down. “Your Grace, Veronika the Swift, we are honored to be here. We come from the little town of Giraffes-“ The Queen’s advisor, Emma, yawned, “No one asked you two idiots. If you want to make it to the Royal School of Ghana you have to complete one more quest”. Daniel from the clan off panda assassins looked up real quick, “A QUEST? WE BARLEY SURVIVED THE JOURNEY HERE, IM STARVING-“ Bogdan smacked his head to him shut up. The annoyed advisor continued, “Yes, the quest is...)

Veronika: ( ...is to hike up the rocky mountains that is home to the trolls (they WILL try to take your map). Then at the peak of the mountain you shall see the promised land of Hydraflia. That is where you will find what you are looking for. But before that- you will face a jungle where the white tigers roam. If you are lucky enough to have survived all of that, then at the end of the jungle will be a portal to Goldavina. In order to unlock the lock to the almighty portal, you shall call out the word “DONAROSA”. IF you mess this up (mispronounce, have a voice crack, get interrupted) then you shall face everlasting doom and be haunted by the ghosts of previous men who have failed. The portal to Goldavina will open if you do not mess it up. Goldavina is 10,000 miles away. You will know you are in the right place. It is covered with gold, filled with chocolate rocks, roamed by pegasi, and is home to the strawberry milk river. Once you get there, you shall look for a witch by the name of BabaYega. Finding her WILL be dangerous and scary, but once you get to her, tell her that the kingdom of Blue Warrior Clan has sent you and she will know what you came for and what to do next. Follow every step￼ precisely how she tells you and bring back what she tells you to bring because it is worth so much in this kingdom of ours. Do NOT screw this up. Nobody knows this, but all of the kingdom’s safety relies on this quest.” Emma the Czar Fince Wise Woman finished and took out the map and instructions of this almighty quest and gave it to the duo. “WAIT,” Veronika the Swift shouted. “I do not think they are capable of this mission! We have sent the strongest, the wisest, the most loyal, yet all have failed! What makes you think that these two cockroaches shall have the responsibility to take on this journey and risk the future of Blue Warrior Clan! I won’t allow this!” Veronika the Swift looked away. The great Queen’s advisor thought for a moment. “I know what to do!” Veronika the Swift glanced at her, “Proceed.” “Someone that has never let us down, someone who is trustworthy, graceful and stronger than any woman I have ever met: Nelly Switcherlink of Dormah! She will accompany you on this journey.” Bogdan and Daniel looked at eachother and then the Queen and the Advisor. “Call out Nelly Switcherlink of Dormah!” 
After 30 seconds, the embroidered gates of the main ￼entrance opened and there came in an elegant yet fierce younger replica of Rapunzel. “Hello friends,” she motioned to the two men, “You ready?” Daniel looked at her in awe with a dumb look on his face. Bogdan noticed and hit his head once more. “Yes ma’am, let’s get to it.” The queen shouted right before they left the palace: “The future of the kingdom and I are relying on you! Don’t let us down!”
The trio smirked at eachother and knew they were in for something exciting. Nelly shouted, “Let’s do dis tang! Off to the rocky mountains!” She said, as she glanced at the map. Right after those words, Bogdan looked up into the sky and noticed...) 


Nelly (noticed...a floating clock up in the sky. "Oh yes! Wait up my young warriors!" Veronika the swift queen exclaimed, then looked at her assistant expecting her to explain as if she didn’t know. "Oh, well...warriors, this amazingly illustrated shining clock that you see floating in the sky, is a timer. This timer will show the time you have left throughout your journey. You will have a week in total for this journey. AND LISTEN TO MY WORDS VERY CARFULLY! Like her majesty, the queen said this mission depends on the safety of our kingdom, if you don’t complete this mission in time YOU WILL BE DOOMED FOR ETERNITYYY. Okay well good luck,
I’m sick and tired of seeing your face, and besides I’m about to miss my lunch break.” The three of them looked at Emma the Czar and queens advisor with great terror and dread; their faces pale. "Can I help you?! Gooo your time has already started by the way!" Nelly Switcherlink of Dormah quickly snapped out of it, while the other two were already distracted by some slug they found. "Oh boy,this will be a long journey" she thought, "cmon boys let’s get going, for our time is limited." So they started to walk away from the palace.  And after about five minutes Bogdan had a question for Nelly Switcherlink of Dormah. "Hey Nelly, so how are you so wise anyway? Like even the queen called you the most wise woman!” Nelly looked down and sighed. "Well...” she said, "it’s sort of a long story.” "We would love to hear it!" Bogdan said as he punched Daniel in the shoulder. Daniel seemed to be a weird misterios creature, quiet with a very questioning smirk, "listen! She is the wisest woman, maybe you can learn at least something from her, you know there is still hope, i hope..." he whispered to Daniel. So Daniel turned his attention towards her. "Okay fine. It all started when I was young. In my hometown people have always seen me as a "goodie two shoes” because they thought I never got in trouble and I was a perfect child. I didn’t deny it because I knew it was true. It’s just who I am. But I was not mad about it. And as time passed, I stayed the same, a goodie goodie. But one day I decided, ' you know what, since I am already a goodie goodie, I want to also become the wisest of all and destroy people with my wisdom.’ So I went to my grandmother house, who was the wisest woman on earth before me, and I trained, it was very tiresome and difficult, it took a whole year! But of course it is worth it, you know it is a lot of hard work.” She said this with a very humble look on her face. "Wow, I wish I could be like you.” Daniel said. “Yes, wisdom is great, but you do not want to be me. I will tell you guys a secret, but do you promise you won’t tell anyone?!" 
"We won’t!” They both said at the same time. 
“Okay, so at night, I turn into a different creature, I become green like a frog, ugly, and completely dumb. This is why you do not want to be me. “ 
“Yeah that is pretty bad". Daniel said without thinking.
“Don’t ever disrespect the wise like that!” Bogdan whispered to Daniel again, “just because she turns ugly doesn’t mean she doesn’t need to be respected anymore!” 
"Oh it’s okay you guys”, Nelly said with tears in her eyes.
"Oh don’t cry-“ Daniel’s words got cut off when they approached the most magnificently clear lake they have ever seen. “This is amazing!” Nelly Switcherlink said. 
"Oh yes it is beautiful...” said Bogdan.
“Looks like a regular old lake to me” Daniel said ruining the atmosphere. 
"You really gotta ruin the vibes like that?!" Bogdan said.
"Now boys, we don’t have a lot of time." Nelly said as she looks up at the clock floating in the sky. 
"Guys look, I see mountains!” Daniel shouted. 
"Yes! Those must be the Rocky Mountains!” Bogdan replied.
"You are right, follow be boys, I know the way." The wise woman said. 
So they followed her, they sometimes fell behind because of their clumsiness, but they always had her hair to follow. 
Now they were traveling in the mountains, and they heard a noise that sounded like rocks falling from the mountains. Little do they know that the trolls where already spying on them.
When they turned around to look at what they thought was there, it was gone. They forgot about the warning on the trolls. As they were hiking up the mountain, something caught her eye...)

Emma( ... The wise Nelly saw a bridge, not your typical Stonebridge, a wobbly skinny broken rope bridge. Once the boys saw the bridge they quickly yeeted, both turning around and quickly walking the other direction. Quickly but swiftly Nelly grabbed their collars and insisted Daniel to go first, saying ”ladies first!” Daniel laughed a sarcastic laugh and insisted Bogdan to go. Bogdan gave Daniel the most petty look ever and said “What do I look like to you, a feather?” Nelly stopped this commotion and said, “Wait I think Daniel is onto something! Bogdan how much do you weigh?” Nelly asked. Uncomfortably, Bogdan says, “160” then she looked at Daniel and asks him for his weight. Proudly he says “160”.  As Wise Nelly was thinking, Daniel started bragging to Bogdan how much weight he has lost, then Bogdan smacked Daniel and said to listen to the wise one. Nelly started to speak as she said, “If Bogdan holds Daniel like a horizontal stick, maybe just maybe, the weight will be balanced out and you guys can walk across the bridge!” With the most confused face,  Bogdan started to argue because he took the highest science class in Mrs. Vandervorts. He said, “This is physically not even possible-“ before Nelly could even say anything, Daniel smacked Bogdan and said to listen to the wise one in a mimicking voice. Bogdan slowly turned his head to the spot where he had been hit, then slowly looked at Daniel. Bogdan rose his hand and Daniel winched but Bogdan didn’t even hit him instead he said, “You’re not worthy enough to be touched” and gave him a disgusted look. Nelly looked at both of them in disbelief and said ”oh boy”. Rolling her eyes she said, “Bogdan please just do as I say. Who’s the wise one here? Exactly me. So, Bogdan grab Daniel like a stick and walk across that unstable bridge!”. At the start you could hear Bogdan mumbling to himself, “Я устала! Я голодная! Почему у меня все disrespect делают!”(gibberish ).Finally Bogdan made it across the bridge, and he threw Daniel on the floor and jumped in victory. While Daniel grabbed his massive cheeks and rubbed them and said ”ow”. Nelly gave the boys a thumbs up and started to walk across the bridge like a model. She did not even take a second to think about the fact that the bridge is unstable and not secure. She made it to the other side flawlessly, and both of the guys jaws dropped. She gave them a look and said ”what” they both stammered and started pointing at the bridge. She rolled her eyes and said, “It’s because I don’t have chicken legs unlike some people”. They both looked at each other and back at her and scoffed. Nelly shook her head and said, “Whatever”. On the other side of the bridge there was a border between the Rocky Mountains and the jungle. In between that border, there laid a big stone that had a glimmering red button. Without even thinking, Daniel sprinted to the button and smashed it. Bogdan yelled at him, saying, “You dyslexic, Mole rat! Read what it says right above the button!” In a carved writing it said: Wake up Trolls. Nelly just looked at Daniel in disappointment and shook her head. Then Daniel looked at them and said “Oops”. In about 3 seconds the ground started to shake and soon there was a bunch of grunting noises. Right after that, three big ugly trolls appeared, standing right in front of them. Daniel screeched in terror and fell on the floor. Bogdan stood behind the wise and Nelly crossed her arms and stood there. The one in the middle, which was their leader, was not the tallest but looked older. His name was BenJ. Then there was another one on the left, tall but scrawny, and by the name of Märk. Last but not least, the troll on the right made stupid racist jokes. His name was Georgē. They were the Idiot Troll Trio. Nelly chuckled for she wasn’t frightened, and in a calm voice said, “Hello there, Benj.” Benj grunted “Hi Nelly... the most UnWiSe woman!” He laughed, sticking both of his crooked hands out and was waiting for the other trolls to give him a high five. Georgē gave him a high five and said, “Yeah! You dishwasher!” and Märk stood there in a paralyzed trance staring at Nelly in awe. Benj smacked Märk and he snapped out keeping his gaze on Nelly. Benj brought his attention back to the three travelers. He crossed his arms and said, “We’re not gonna let you pass,” and Georgē mimicked him, saying, “Yeah! We’re not gonna let you through!” Benj looked at Georgē and told him to shut up. Georgē, desperately wanting Benj’s approval, listened and hushed up like a puppy. Benj looked at Nelly and continued, “Well. You may pass but you must answer to this riddle correctly. Then I will let you pass through. Ehem... What’s black and white and red all over?” Georgē cackled and smirked saying, “a cow that’s been shot!” He and Märk gave each other a high-five. Benj grabbed both of them by their troll heads and collided their heads together(“Crash”). He let go of them both after that which left bruises on their crusty foreheads. Nelly, Bogdan, and Daniel huddled up in a group and they were discussing over the riddle. Daniel rose his hand and shouted, “Oooh! Oooh! Is it a dying penguin?” Bogdan smacked him and said, “Listen to the wise one!”
Nelly thought for a minute and then finally answered, “A NEWS PAPER!” The boys agreed with her and she turned around to the troll, giving him the answer. The trolls were so shocked that Nelly The Wise figured out the riddle. Benj got so boiling furious and he saw the map that Nelly was holding in her hands. He snatched it out of her hands and all of the three trolls ran to the tropical jungle. Nelly, Bogdan and Daniel stood there in shock. Nelly looked at the boys and said, “Don’t just stand there! GERRUM!”. So all three of them started running after the three other trolls. As they were running into the jungle, the three noticed an object in a large jungle river...)
