    Each year men from all around the country in each village and town would come together to have matches. The strongest
        and wisest would gain permission to be visited by the queen, and receive the honor of attending the Royal School 
        off Ghana. 
In the little town of Giraffes, two men were able to stand against all odds Daniel from the clan off panda assassins, 
        and Bogdan from the Mages of the Holy Cross. And now today was the coronation of these two men. As they stood 
        at the entrance of the gates, awaiting the arrival of the Queen. They saw her in the distance moving in with a 
        group of 80 armed soldiers and the Queen of worshitania who went by the name of Veronika the Swift was riding 
        her Great Elephant from the Blue warrior clan, while right beside her was her great advisor following, Emma the 
        Czar Fince Wise Woman.

The Queen finally approached the two men with a disgusted look. “These? This tall stick and pale rock are the supposed 
  victors?” Bogdan and Daniel immediately bowed down. “Your Grace, Veronika the Swift, we are honored to be here. We 
  come from the little town of Giraffes-“ The Queen’s advisor, Emma, yawned, “No one asked you two idiots. If you want
  to make it to the Royal School of Ghana you have to complete one more quest”. Daniel from the clan off panda assassins
  looked up real quick, “A QUEST? WE BARLEY SURVIVED THE JOURNEY HERE, IM STARVING-“ Bogdan smacked his head to him shut
  up. The annoyed advisor continued, “Yes, the quest is...)

      <br>

    <h3>
       
Is to hike up the rocky mountains that is home to the trolls (they WILL try to take your map). Then at the peak of
      the mountain you shall see the promised land of Hydraflia. That is where you will find what you are looking for. 
      But before that- you will face a jungle where the white tigers roam. If you are lucky enough to have survived all 
      of that, then at the end of the jungle will be a portal to Goldavina. In order to unlock the lock to the almighty 
      portal, you shall call out the word “DONAROSA”. IF you mess this up (mispronounce, have a voice crack, get interrupted)
      then you shall face everlasting doom and be haunted by the ghosts of previous men who have failed.
      The portal to Goldavina will open if you do not mess it up. Goldavina is 10,000 miles away. You will
      know you are in the right place. It is covered with gold, filled with chocolate rocks, roamed by pegasi,
      and is home to the strawberry milk river. Once you get there, you shall look for a witch by the name of BabaYega. 
      Finding her WILL be dangerous and scary, but once you get to her, tell her that the kingdom of Blue Warrior 
      Clan has sent you and she will know what you came for and what to do next. Follow every step￼ precisely how she 
      tells you and bring back what she tells you to bring because it is worth so much in this kingdom of ours. Do
      NOT screw this up. Nobody knows this, but all of the kingdom’s safety relies on this quest.” Emma the Czar Fince 
      Wise Woman finished and took out the map and instructions of this almighty quest and gave it to the duo. “WAIT,” 
      Veronika the Swift shouted. “I do not think they are capable of this mission! We have sent the strongest, the wisest, 
      the most loyal, yet all have failed! What makes you think that these two cockroaches shall have the responsibility 
      to take on this journey and risk the future of Blue Warrior Clan! I won’t allow this!” Veronika the Swift looked away.
      The great Queen’s advisor thought for a moment. “I know what to do!” Veronika the Swift glanced at her, “Proceed.”
      “Someone that has never let us down, someone who is trustworthy, graceful and stronger than any woman I have ever
      met: Nelly Switcherlink of Dormah! She will accompany you on this journey.” Bogdan and Daniel looked at eachother 
      and then the Queen and the Advisor. “Call out Nelly Switcherlink of Dormah!” 
After 30 seconds, the embroidered gates of the main ￼entrance opened and there came in an elegant yet fierce younger
      replica of Rapunzel. “Hello friends,” she motioned to the two men, “You ready?” Daniel looked at her in awe with
      a dumb look on his face. Bogdan noticed and hit his head once more. “Yes ma’am, let’s get to it.” The queen shouted 
      right before they left the palace: “The future of the kingdom and I are relying on you! Don’t let us down!”
The trio smirked at eachother and knew they were in for something exciting. Nelly shouted, “Let’s do dis tang! Off to the
      rocky mountains!” She said, as she glanced at the map. Right after those words, Bogdan looked up into the sky and 
      noticed...)

Noticed...a floating clock up in the sky. "Oh yes! Wait up my young warriors!" Veronika the swift queen exclaimed, 
  then looked at her assistant expecting her to explain as if she didn’t know. "Oh, well...warriors, this amazingly 
  illustrated shining clock that you see floating in the sky, is a timer. This timer will show the time you have left 
  throughout your journey. You will have a week in total for this journey. AND LISTEN TO MY WORDS VERY CARFULLY! Like
  her majesty, the queen said this mission depends on the safety of our kingdom, if you don’t complete this mission in
  time YOU WILL BE DOOMED FOR ETERNITYYY. Okay well good luck,
I’m sick and tired of seeing your face, and besides I’m about to miss my lunch break.” The three of them looked at Emma 
  the Czar and queens advisor with great terror and dread; their faces pale. "Can I help you?! Gooo your time has already
  started by the way!" Nelly Switcherlink of Dormah quickly snapped out of it, while the other two were already 
  distracted by some slug they found. "Oh boy,this will be a long journey" she thought, "cmon boys let’s get going, 
  for our time is limited." So they started to walk away from the palace.  And after about five minutes Bogdan had
  a question for Nelly Switcherlink of Dormah. "Hey Nelly, so how are you so wise anyway? Like even the queen called 
  you the most wise woman!” Nelly looked down and sighed. "Well...” she said, "it’s sort of a long story.”
  "We would love to hear it!" Bogdan said as he punched Daniel in the shoulder. Daniel seemed to be a weird 
  mysterious creature, quiet with a very questioning smirk, "listen! She is the wisest woman, maybe you can 
  learn at least something from her, you know there is still hope, i hope..." he whispered to Daniel. So
  Daniel turned his attention towards her. "Okay fine. It all started when I was young. In my hometown people have 
  always seen me as a "goodie two shoes” because they thought I never got in trouble and I was a perfect child. I didn’t 
  deny it because I knew it was true. It’s just who I am. But I was not mad about it. And as time passed, I stayed the same,
  a goodie goodie. But one day I decided, ' you know what, since I am already a goodie goodie, I want to also become the
  wisest of all and destroy people with my wisdom.’ So I went to my grandmother house, who was the wisest woman on earth
  before me, and I trained, it was very tiresome and difficult, it took a whole year! But of course it is worth it,
  you know it is a lot of hard work.” She said this with a very humble look on her face. "Wow, I wish I could be like you.”
  Daniel said. “Yes, wisdom is great, but you do not want to be me. I will tell you guys a secret, but do you promise you
  won’t tell anyone?!" 
"We won’t!” They both said at the same time. 
“Okay, so at night, I turn into a different creature, I become green like a frog, ugly, and completely dumb. This is 
  why you do not want to be me. “ 
“Yeah that is pretty bad". Daniel said without thinking.
“Don’t ever disrespect the wise like that!” Bogdan whispered to Daniel again, “just because she turns ugly doesn’t mean 
  she doesn’t need to be respected anymore!” 
"Oh it’s okay you guys”, Nelly said with tears in her eyes.
"Oh don’t cry-“ Daniel’s words got cut off when they approached the most magnificently clear lake they have ever seen.
  “This is amazing!” Nelly Switcherlink said. 
    
   </h3>     <br>
      <br><br>
      
   <h3> 
   
"Oh yes it is beautiful...” said Bogdan.
“Looks like a regular old lake to me” Daniel said ruining the atmosphere. 
"You really gotta ruin the vibes like that?!" Bogdan said.
"Now boys, we don’t have a lot of time." Nelly said as she looks up at the clock floating in the sky. 
"Guys look, I see mountains!” Daniel shouted. 
"Yes! Those must be the Rocky Mountains!” Bogdan replied.
"You are right, follow be boys, I know the way." The wise woman said. 
So they followed her, they sometimes fell behind because of their clumsiness, but they always had her hair to follow. 
Now they were traveling in the mountains, and they heard a noise that sounded like rocks falling from the mountains. 
     Little do they know that the trolls where already spying on them.
When they turned around to look at what they thought was there, it was gone. They forgot about the warning on the trolls. 
     As they were hiking up the mountain, something caught her eye...)

The wise Nelly saw a bridge, not your typical Stonebridge, a wobbly skinny broken rope bridge. Once the boys saw the bridge
      they quickly yeeted, both turning around and quickly walking the other direction. Quickly but swiftly Nelly grabbed 
      their collars and insisted Daniel to go first, saying ”ladies first!” Daniel laughed a sarcastic laugh and insisted 
      Bogdan to go. Bogdan gave Daniel the most petty look ever and said “What do I look like to you, a feather?” Nelly 
      stopped this commotion and said, “Wait I think Daniel is onto something! Bogdan how much do you weigh?” Nelly asked.
      Uncomfortably, Bogdan says, “160” then she looked at Daniel and asks him for his weight. Proudly he says “160”.  
      As Wise Nelly was thinking, Daniel started bragging to Bogdan how much weight he has lost, then Bogdan smacked Daniel
      and said to listen to the wise one. Nelly started to speak as she said, “If Bogdan holds Daniel like a horizontal 
      stick, maybe just maybe, the weight will be balanced out and you guys can walk across the bridge!” With the most
      confused face,  Bogdan started to argue because he took the highest science class in Mrs. Vandervorts. He said,
      “This is physically not even possible-“ before Nelly could even say anything, Daniel smacked Bogdan and said to 
      listen to the wise one in a mimicking voice. Bogdan slowly turned his head to the spot where he had been hit, then
      slowly looked at Daniel. Bogdan rose his hand and Daniel winched but Bogdan didn’t even hit him instead he said,
      “You’re not worthy enough to be touched” and gave him a disgusted look. Nelly looked at both of them in disbelief 
      and said ”oh boy”. Rolling her eyes she said, “Bogdan please just do as I say. Who’s the wise one here? Exactly me.
      So, Bogdan grab Daniel like a stick and walk across that unstable bridge!”. At the start you could hear Bogdan mumbling
      to himself, “Я устала! Я голодная! Почему у меня все disrespect делают!”(gibberish ).Finally Bogdan made it across 
      the bridge, and he threw Daniel on the floor and jumped in victory. While Daniel grabbed his massive cheeks and 
      rubbed them and said ”ow”. Nelly gave the boys a thumbs up and started to walk across the bridge like a model.
      She did not even take a second to think about the fact that the bridge is unstable and not secure. She made it 
      to the other side flawlessly, and both of the guys jaws dropped. She gave them a look and said ”what” they both
      stammered and started pointing at the bridge. She rolled her eyes and said, “It’s because I don’t have chicken 
      legs unlike some people”. They both looked at each other and back at her and scoffed. Nelly shook her head and said,
      “Whatever”. On the other side of the bridge there was a border between the Rocky Mountains and the jungle. In between
      that border, there laid a big stone that had a glimmering red button. Without even thinking, Daniel sprinted to the
      button and smashed it.

    <h3>
      
      Bogdan yelled at him, saying, “You dyslexic, Mole rat! Read what it says right above the button!” In a carved writing 
      it said: Wake up Trolls. Nelly just looked at Daniel in disappointment and shook her head. Then Daniel looked at them
      and said “Oops”. In about 3 seconds the ground started to shake and soon there was a bunch of grunting noises. Right
      after that, three big ugly trolls appeared, standing right in front of them. Daniel screeched in terror and fell on 
      the floor. Bogdan stood behind the wise and Nelly crossed her arms and stood there. The one in the middle, which was 
      their leader, was not the tallest but looked older. His name was BenJ. Then there was another one on the left, tall
      but scrawny, and by the name of Märk. Last but not least, the troll on the right made stupid racist jokes. His name 
      was Georgē. They were the Idiot Troll Trio. Nelly chuckled for she wasn’t frightened, and in a calm voice said, “Hello 
      there, Benj.” Benj grunted “Hi Nelly... the most UnWiSe woman!” He laughed, sticking both of his crooked hands out and
      was waiting for the other trolls to give him a high five. Georgē gave him a high five and said, “Yeah! You dishwasher!”
      and Märk stood there in a paralyzed trance staring at Nelly in awe. Benj smacked Märk and he snapped out keeping his 
      gaze on Nelly. Benj brought his attention back to the three travelers. He crossed his arms and said, “We’re not gonna 
      let you pass,” and Georgē mimicked him, saying, “Yeah! We’re not gonna let you through!” Benj looked at Georgē and
      told him to shut up. Georgē, desperately wanting Benj’s approval, listened and hushed up like a puppy. Benj looked at
      Nelly and continued, “Well. You may pass but you must answer to this riddle correctly. Then I will let you pass through. 
      Ehem... What’s black and white and red all over?” Georgē cackled and smirked saying, “a cow that’s been shot!”
      He and Märk
      gave each other a high-five. Benj grabbed both of them by their troll heads and collided 
      their heads together(“Crash”). He 
      let go of them both after that which left bruises on their crusty foreheads. Nelly, Bogdan, and Daniel huddled up in a 
      group and they were discussing over the riddle. Daniel rose his hand and shouted, “Oooh! Oooh! Is it a dying penguin?”
      Bogdan smacked him and said, “Listen to the wise one!”
Nelly thought for a minute and then finally answered, “A NEWS PAPER!” The boys agreed with her and she turned around to
      the troll, giving him the answer. The trolls were so shocked that Nelly The Wise figured out the riddle. Benj got so 
      boiling furious and he saw the map that Nelly was holding in her hands. He snatched it out of her hands and all of 
      the three trolls ran to the tropical jungle. Nelly, Bogdan and Daniel stood there in shock. Nelly looked at the boys
      and said, “Don’t just stand there! GERRUM!”. So all three of them started running after the three other trolls. As they 
      were running into the jungle, the three noticed an object in a large jungle river.. 
       
</h3>
 
<br>
      <br>
      <br>
    <h3>
      David(... The Object was a ship. As they ran, the ship got closer,
        but the ship wasn't on any surface. IT WAS ACTUALLY FLOATING in the sky. The trolls ran and hopped
        into the ship and started to float away, a new troll appeared on the ship, he called himself the Great Tim, and he
        strongly scolded the other trolls saying "you are fake, enjoying the outside world, I rebuke you" while the trolls
      were yelling with a gibberish accent.
        As the ship became distant, Nelly yelled "Enough, there is no way no way we will reach them”. As Nelly took her
      breath, she said with a loud voice, "we will head in the direction the ship floated away, since we don’t have the map, 
      its our only option". So Danik and Bogdan being clueless followed Nelly as she jogged toward the direction of the ship.
The trip was long, the rain poured, even earthquakes were quite present, they continued to run. Danik making an excuses said 
      "guys I think my leg is broken", Nelly being as innocent as she is pitied Danik. So out of her wisdom created a sled
      and dragged Danik behind her as they continued through the dark yellow mountains.
Finally they arrived at a huge blue gate, Bogdan being relived said “finally we got somewhere, I was about to puke, we
      ran for a whole 15 minutes". Nelly threw the rope behind her back and was like "your right, we did get somewhere, 
      but where?”, Danik being as conceited as he is, got off the sled and said "I think this is the home of the trolls”.
      But bogdan being the gentleman he is, whacked Danik “bAnG!!!” on the back of his head, yelling "how dare you make 
      Nelly a lady carry you, you capper”. Danik with tears in his eyes replied "I just thought that my leg was broken”. 
      Super angrily amused bogdan fell into a coma out of shock, so now instead of Danik, Nelly carried Bogdan on the sled 
      as they approached the blue gate.

  As they got closer to the blue gate, a loud voice was heard in the distance, "who is it that dares to cross my land, 
      is it a friend or a foe?". Buzzed and scared Danik, hides behind Nelly, and Nelly in return cries out "who are you,
      we are adventurers from the Blue Elephant Clan, we come to get the Map that was stolen by trolls", the Voice in 
      return yells out "I am the great Gate Keeper of this land, I go by the name of Alex, there are no trolls in this 
      land, you might have mistaken them for the tiny humans that live in this area, they dress up as trolls to scare
      off evildoers. If you can guess my riddle I'll let you in". Nelly yells out in return, "Whats the riddle?". 
  Gatekeeper replies, "HO HO HA, THE RIDDLE IS THIS, TROLL AND HUMAN, WERE SITTING ON THE SAME BOAT, THE TROLL FAINTED 
  AND FELL OFF, WHILE THE HUMAN DECIDED TO SWIM AWAY...NOW? WHO WAS LEFT?

 "Screech", doors open, Bogdan wakes up, and as they all enter into the blue gate, Danik looking at Bogdan said, "whats 
      up with your face", in return Bogdon said ”Who are you". Danik totally just fell into a shocked expression, and 
      really believed that he lost his memory and stopped asking questions, but nelly new it was a play by bogdan just 
      to keep Danik on the leash.

Not the land they entered was beautiful, flowers and trees grew everywhere, even the roads seemed so perfectly smooth,
      as it was a live painting, they got onto a trial and headed in its direction, they approached a red small house,
      about five feet deep. And danik being as disturbing as he is, decided to knock the on the front door, but before
      he did he tripped over a small stick, and using his head fell and broke into the door "Dang". Looking around in
      shock, he saw a whole fmaily of trolls a number to be more than 50, and he started yelling. Seeing danik and his
      face, the small humans thought they were being attacked by a wild donkey beast, that roams their lands as told 
      in the legends. Pulled the fire alarm, and the group immideatly got circled around by 60 mini human soldiers.
